🔬 Research Thesis: Thermofluid Characterization of a High-Performance Desktop PC
🚀 Project Overview
This research project presents an in-depth thermofluid analysis of a high-performance desktop computing system engineered with a rigid copper hardline, single-loop liquid cooling architecture. The system was built to accommodate and thermally stabilize the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU and the NVIDIA RTX 5090 Waterforce WB GPU within the constraints of a mid-tower enclosure — with a focus on spatial efficiency, sustained thermal headroom, and performance stability under full-load conditions.

🛠️ Key Components & Methodology
Full-system custom build with copper tubing

Inline flow rate and temperature sensors

FLIR thermographic imaging

Synthetic and real-world workloads:
Cinebench R23, 3DMark, PCMark 10, and continuous gaming benchmarks

Dual 360mm high-pressure radiators with push-pull fan configurations

Controlled ambient testing conditions

🔍 Objective: Characterize heat distribution and performance of a copper hardline loop under extended workloads, and assess system equilibrium, throttling behavior, and loop responsiveness.

📊 Findings
Stable thermal equilibrium under all tested scenarios

No CPU/GPU throttling observed, even during peak loads

Even thermal distribution validated with FLIR imaging

High system reliability and noise-normalized cooling efficiency

🧪 Ongoing Work
Future experimentation will explore direct-die cooling by removing the integrated heat spreader (IHS), aiming to reduce thermal resistance and improve transient heat response during intensive workloads.
