## 🔬 Research Thesis: Thermofluid Characterization of a High-Performance Desktop PC

### 🚀 Project Overview

This research project presents an in-depth thermofluid analysis of a high-performance desktop computing system engineered with a **rigid copper hardline, single-loop liquid cooling architecture**. The system was built to thermally stabilize the **AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D** CPU and the **NVIDIA RTX 5090 Waterforce WB GPU** within a mid-tower enclosure — emphasizing **spatial efficiency, thermal reliability**, and **high-load performance equilibrium**.

### 🛠️ Key Components & Methodology

- Custom copper tubing loop with Mayhems Hades+ and Inhibitor+ additives
- Inline temperature and flow rate sensors
- FLIR thermographic imaging
- Dual 360mm radiators with push-pull Noctua NF-F12 iPPC 3000 PWM fans
- Synthetic workloads and gaming stress tests:
  - Cinebench R23
  - 3DMark (Steel Nomad, Port Royal)
  - PCMark 10
  - Extended gaming and idle scenarios
- Controlled ambient conditions, including room temperature and humidity tracking

### 📊 Key Findings

- **Stable thermal equilibrium** across all workload categories
- **Zero observed thermal throttling** on CPU or GPU
- **Even loop-wide heat distribution** confirmed via thermal imaging
- Long-term performance maintained within optimal thermal margins

### 🧪 Future Work

- Implementing **direct-die cooling** by delidding the CPU and eliminating the IHS
- Evaluating gains in transient response and thermal conductivity under burst workloads
