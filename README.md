I completed an 85-page research thesis focused on the thermofluid characterization of a high-performance desktop computing system featuring a rigid copper hardline single-loop liquid cooling architecture. The system was engineered to sustain the thermal demands of an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Waterforce WB GPU within a mid-tower enclosure, emphasizing spatial efficiency and thermal headroom under continuous high-load operations.

The project integrated a full system build with experimental analysis, using inline temperature and flow sensors, FLIR thermal imaging, and a suite of benchmark workloads (Cinebench R23, 3DMark, PCMark 10, etc...). Results confirmed stable thermal equilibrium, with excellent temperature margins across CPU and GPU components, no observed thermal throttling, and uniform heat distribution throughout the loop.

My manuscript, titled ‚ÄúThermofluid Characterization and Performance Evaluation of a Copper Hardline-Cooled High-Performance Computing System‚Äù, has been endorsed by my university for publication and is currently being prepared for peer review at Elsevier‚Äôs Applied Thermal Engineering journal.

Future work will include a comparative analysis of direct-die cooling, eliminating the integrated heat spreader to improve thermal conductivity and transient response characteristics under intensive computational workloads.
